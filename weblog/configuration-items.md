# Configuration Items

_Note: This page is a work in progress._

Let’s take a look at each of the specific configuration items in your weblog. There’s a lot here, but one thing to keep in mind is that you don’t have to deal with all of this—just change whatever you feel like changing. You can leave as much of the defaults intact as you’d like.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Item</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Default Value</th>
</tr>

<tbody>

<tr>
<td>Weblog title</td>
<td>The title of your weblog, used with the `{title}` tag.</td>
<td>
